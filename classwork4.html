    <h1>POP CULTURE</h1>
    <p>Pop culture, short for popular culture, is the collection of mainstream practices, beliefs, trends, and products <i>(like music, movies, fashion, tech, slang)</i> that are dominant and widely accessible in a society at a given time, driven by mass media, consumerism, and social interaction, serving as a shared cultural language and a reflection of societal changes. It contrasts with <i>high culture</i>, being accessible to everyone, constantly evolving, and shaped by both creators and passionate fan communities. </p>
